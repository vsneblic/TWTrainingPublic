Notes from Day

- Request for Agile Project Tools
- E/P/I
	Lots of high E - highest 60% x3.
	Generally I > P.
- Rectangle
	A few tests, one before code.
	No one broke encapsulation.
- Chance
	Lots of confusion.
	Lots of leaking of data.
	Drove out equals before not.
	Had to give away new Chance in not.
	Just started and design.
