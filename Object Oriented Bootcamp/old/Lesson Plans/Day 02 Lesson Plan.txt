Finish Chance - Wendy
	and
		reference code
		new pairs
	or
		give DeMorgan's early iff they ask
		unless someone gets it - do multiple 15 minutes
		churn - how many objects created here
	work in simple design
		it works
		it communicates
		no duplicate code
		no extra code
	hand out synopsis


Object Interactions Lecture - Joe

Square - Joe

Quantity (Liquid) - Wendy
	3 != 3
		5 minute design

	give data points
		5 minute simple test
		discuss
	code
	Most Suspicious Statement - Wendy (whenever we see a bunch of ifs)
	
Quantity (Distance) - Joe
	give data points

Pairing Demo is Fill to End of Day if Needed
Factory Methods - s & es - Another Fill Option

============================================================
Notes

Safety as expected for day 2.
And - very quick.
Or
	Two Venn implementations.  Two brute force (non-working) implementations.
	Gave DeMorgan's Formula - 15 minutes after lunch to code.
Square
	Everyone did subclass.
	Tried to drive factory method in discussion.
	No participation so did 2nd 15 minutes.
Quantity
	1st 5 - aha very late
	2nd 5 - objects
