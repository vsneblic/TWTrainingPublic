This is the main repository for the ThoughtWorks Training team's material. 

ThoughtWorks Studios Training has an individual folder for each course that is our "external" to-the-rest-of-TW folder. This is the active place for our courses. Each folder has the following subfolders:

◦	Master: The latest-and-greatest version of the course, not to be messed with by anyone other than the course product owner(s).

◦	Updates: Notes and suggested new material to be reviewed/incorporated into the Master on a regular basis by the course product owner(s).

◦	Deliveries: Instances of the course given as discrete engagements ("Agile Dev Practices - Cebu May 2012"). A historical repository.
